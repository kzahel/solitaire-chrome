Was trying to play this one day. It says it's offline:

https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/offline-solitaire/ojldfpglenpceffckkjhajofdbpkfgmn
http://offlinebrowsergames.appspot.com/index.html

But I got a 503 error server:
```
Over Quota

This application is temporarily over its serving quota. Please try again later.
```

So I made it actually work offline
